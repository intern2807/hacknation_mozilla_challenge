# Third-Party Testing: Generate & Import

When a **third-party developer** (or the user) wants to **test their app** that uses the Web Agents API (`window.ai` / `window.agent`) and is building on Harbor, help them get the **test harness** from this repo so they can accelerate testing.

## How they get the harness

1. **Generate into their project (recommended)**  
   From the **Harbor repo root** run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-test-harness.mjs /path/to/their/project
   ```
   This creates `their-project/harbor-test/` with:
   - `mock.js` – installable mock for `window.ai` and `window.agent` (unit tests, no browser)
   - `playwright.harbor.config.example.ts` – Playwright config for E2E with extensions
   - `fixtures/harbor.ts` – optional Playwright fixture
   - `web-agents-api.d.ts` – TypeScript declarations
   - `README.md` – how to use each piece

2. **Copy from the template**  
   If they can’t run the script (e.g. they only have a clone or Cursor is in their project and Harbor is referenced), **copy the contents** of `spec/testing/harness-template/` into their project (e.g. into `harbor-test/` or `tests/harbor/`). Same files as above.

3. **Point Cursor at Harbor**  
   If they’re in **their** project and have added Harbor as a reference (e.g. `@harbor` or path to Harbor repo), you can:
   - Suggest they run the generator from their machine (clone Harbor, then `node path/to/harbor/scripts/generate-test-harness.mjs .` from their project root), or
   - Copy the template files from Harbor’s `spec/testing/harness-template/` into their project and tell them how to import the mock and use the Playwright example.

## What to tell them

- **Unit / integration tests:** Use `installWebAgentsMock(globalThis)` (or `window` in a browser env), then e.g. `mock.permissions.grantAll()`, `mock.ai.textSessionResponse = '...'`. Their code that calls `window.ai` / `window.agent` then runs against the mock.
- **E2E tests:** They need Playwright and the two extension paths (Harbor + Web Agents API). The generated `playwright.harbor.config.example.ts` shows how to load both extensions; they set `HARBOR_EXTENSION_PATH` and `WEB_AGENTS_EXTENSION_PATH` to their Harbor build output (e.g. `extension/dist-chrome`, `web-agents-api/dist-chrome`).
- **Entry points in Harbor:** `spec/testing/README.md`, `docs/THIRD_PARTY_TESTING_PLAN.md`, and this rule.

## When this applies

- User asks how to test their app that uses Harbor or the Web Agents API.
- User wants a “test harness,” “mocks for window.ai,” or “E2E with Harbor extensions.”
- User has referenced Harbor (or is in Harbor) and wants to give another team or project a way to test Harbor-based code.

Do **not** use this rule for Harbor’s own internal tests (those live under `tests/` and use `tests/e2e/fixtures/`); this rule is for **external** developers building on top of Harbor.
